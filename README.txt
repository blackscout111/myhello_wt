This is a Wt project that is pretty much a copy of the hello.wt project that Wt
has in their examples section.  I used this to learn some of the basics of Wt as
I followed along on their short tutorial.

Feel free to use this code!  Please just reference me in the code that uses this
as "Bryan A. Clifford".  Email me with any questions/comments/constructive
feedback at "blackscout111@gmail.com".
